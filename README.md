Electric Car Controller
An example that uses the Bluetooth Joystick to control an RC car with a single motor and servo steering. Uses the L298N motor controller and the HC05 Bluetooth module for communication.

HC05 BT Interface
A bare framework that includes all neccesary code to communicate with the Bluetooth Joystick app using a HC05 Bluetooth module.

HC05 L298N Interface
A bare framework that includes all neccesary code to communicate with the Bluetooth Joystick app using a HC05 Bluetooth module. Also includes functions to easily interact with two motors connected to a L298N motor controller.

L298N Arcade Drive Controller
An example that uses the Bluetooth Joystick to control an RC car with dual motors. Uses the L298N motor controller and the HC05 Bluetooth module for communication.
